##Introduction to the game

##Lessen learned

###Challenges
- the most challenging part was learning in an apropriet time the technology stack. 
- The challenge was to review the pull requests in a reasonable amount of time and then to implement the reviews.
While this was a time-consuming process, it helps to understand the code and how the program works.
Thus, with each pull request, several people knew how far the user stories were implemented.


###About teamwork
- What we enjoyed the most was playing the game in real life on a map and then later online every week, which has two huge advantages:
    1. It supported our team building process
    2. We test our game online every week

- Weekly meetings of the whole group at the Irchel have simplified communication. Meeting in person has the advantage that problems can be discussed bilaterally and the others can continue to work, but at the same time can listen with one ear.
	
- The use of Git and the clarification of how we work with this tool has made it much easier to edit the software efficiently, the main feature of Git we used was: 
    1. Pull-request
    2. Feature-Branch
