## Diagrams

### Database Schema

### Class Diagram
The class diagram that we handed in for M2 was quite sparse what was pointed out in the feedback. It has grown
significantly (and also changed a bit) meanwhile the development process and because we use it permanently as a basis
for our common understanding, we decided to hand in the extended version again with the report for M3.
