## Api Documentation

Start the application and visit /swagger-ui.html to see a swagger ui with the api documentation.

## Introduction
World famous card game played with 36 Swiss "Jasskarten". 

## Technologies
### Gradle

![gradle](./doc/img/gradle.png)

For building and deploying the software Gradle was in use with the following plugins:
- Spring Boot (Spring Boot support in Gradle)
- Spring Dependency Management (project's dependencies version control)
- Spotless for code validation (clean code, adhering to coding standard)
- IDEA (Intellij IDEA customized import)
- JaCoCo (Code coverage)
- SonarQube (static code analysis and technical code quality evaluation)

### Spring Framework
![spring](./doc/img/spring.png) 

#### Spring Boot
Spring Boot helps with the creation of stand-alone Spring based applications.

#### Spring Data
The rapid api development architecture provided by spring-data-rest was used to develop the api.
It provides an easy way to build REST web services on top of the data repositories. The
PagingAndSortingRepositories provide request handling, deserialization, crud on the database,
serialization and rendering of errors. Validation was implemented with Bean validations and if
necessary with Spring event handlers. Side effects were also done with Spring event handlers.

### Hibernate
![hibernate](./doc/img/hibernate.png)

The data was stored in a hibernate database which offers an object relational mapping of the data.
This means object oriented entities can be stored in a relational database.

### JPA
Jakarta Persistence API is the API for storing, retrieving, updating and deleting relational database
entries in an object oriented context.

### Rapid API
![rapid api](./doc/img/rapid_api.png)

??? --> Frontend?

### PlantUML
![plant](./doc/img/plant_uml.png)

UML diagrams were created with PlantUML plain text language.

### Git, Github
The versioning of the source code and other files was maintained by Git ont the GitHub platform.
The GitHubs Actions feature was used for automated build, test and deployment of the software.

## High-level components
### Database
All entities used for the game are persisted during a running game. The main reason is that Spring Data REST
offers various possibilities to implement validations and side effects in an easy way.
- Bean validation (uniqueness, not null, format etc.)
- Ensure referential integrity
- Locking data for updates (ensure consistency)
- Side effects: triggering some additional (game) logic before or after creating, updating or deleting an entity

### Game Logic (side effects)
The game logic was mainly part of the EventHandlers. They implemented so-called side effects which were triggered
by certain database interactions. Spring ApplicationListener listens to creating, saving and deleting
events and executes then the logic with the corresponding annotation (e.g. a method with the `@HandleAfterSave`
annotation is executed after the update of an entity).

### Validations
Validations are implemented in several places. Format validations are implemented on entities level
by bean validations. Some Validator classes dedicated to specific entities do further game validations.
The CardValidator class for example ensures that a player can not play two cards in the same round.

Validation errors as well as technical exceptions from Java or Hibernate are catched and transformed 
in appropriate HTTP status codes with informal exception messages to prevent technical errors in the
frontend.

### Security
#### Authentication
For entering the game lobby, creating and/or participating in a game an authenticated instance of a player
is required. On the starting page a visitor can register as a player. At the moment of storing a player, 
a security context with a dedicated authentication token is established with spring security libraries.
 This transferred between frontend and backend by cookies
within the http requests.

All interactions on entities which are exposed for http requests are protected the WebSecurity configuration
which only allows to call the /players endpoint without any valid authentication.

#### Authorization
An authenticated instance does not automatically allow interaction with the backend. Data is protected by
expression-based access control. Without the role 'PLAYER' no data can be saved or deleted.

There is more game specific authorization logic implemented.

| Name      | Authorization                            | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| playsIn   | Participates in a specific a game. | Interaction on any object of a game is only allowed for players being part of the same game themselves. |
| isOwnCard | Card entity in the hand of a player.     | Whether a card can be read or updated depends on the ownership of the card.                             |

The two authorizations, especially IsOwnCard, end up in a precisely determined ruleset on task can be executed or not at which point in time. The most
important rules are implemented by the following methods.

### Serialization/Deserialization
Data transmission is done with Jackson JSON serializer and deserializer. Only for transmission of card objects
the serializer is overwritten by a special serializer (CardSerializer). The reason for that is that displaying
cards to a user depends on the round. Normally players can see their own cards and cards of the other players
are hidden. In the round 5 where only one card is distributed per player, it's in reverse. Therefore serialize
method had to be overwritten such that players can't see their own cards but all the other player's cards instead.

## Launch & Deployment
@Lucius? :)

## Roadmap
### Top features to contribute
- Sound effects when playing card, winning / loosing trick, winning the game etc.
- Implement different manners of score point calculation
- User profiles to store players performance

## Contributors
Screw your neighbor application was developed in context of the SoPra (Software Praktikum / Software Engineerin Lab)
module at the _Institut f√ºr Informatik_ at the University of Zurich by Lucius Bachmann, Beat Furrer, Carmen Kirchdorfer, Moris Camporesi
and Salome Wildermuth.

Any new contributor hearts, welcome to our Screw-your-neighbor-family. Please don't hesitate to open a PR or an issue if there's
something that needs improvement or if you want to help implementing one of our roadmap features!
